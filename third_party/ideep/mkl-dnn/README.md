oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) is an open-source cross-platform
performance library of basic building blocks for deep learning applications.
The library is optimized for Intel Architecture Processors, Intel Processor
Graphics and Xe architecture-based Graphics. Support for other architectures
such as Arm\* 64-bit Architecture (AArch64), OpenPOWER\* Power ISA (PPC64),
and IBMz\* (s390x) is experimental.
See the [System Requirements](#system-requirements) section below.

  model, supported functionality, and implementation details, and
  includes annotated examples.
* [API reference](https://oneapi-src.github.io/oneDNN/modules.html) provides
  a comprehensive reference of the library API.

# Installation

Pre-built binaries for Linux\*, Windows\*, and macOS\* are available
for download in the
[releases section](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDNN/releases). Package
names use the following convention:

| OS      | Package name
| :------ | :-----------
| Linux   | `dnnl_lnx_<version>_cpu_<cpu runtime>[_gpu_<gpu runtime>].tgz`
| Windows | `dnnl_win_<version>_cpu_<cpu runtime>[_gpu_<gpu runtime>].zip`
| macOS   | `dnnl_mac_<version>_cpu_<cpu runtime>.tgz`

Several packages are available for each operating system to ensure
interoperability with CPU or GPU runtime libraries used by the application.

| Configuration | Dependency
| :-------------| :---------
| `cpu_iomp`    | Intel OpenMP runtime
| `cpu_gomp`    | GNU\* OpenMP runtime
| `cpu_vcomp`   | Microsoft Visual C OpenMP runtime
| `cpu_tbb`     | Threading Building Blocks (TBB)

The packages do not include library dependencies and these need to be resolved
in the application at build time. See the
[System Requirements](#system-requirements) section below and the
[Build Options](https://oneapi-src.github.io/oneDNN/dev_guide_build_options.html)
section in the [developer guide](https://oneapi-src.github.io/oneDNN) for more
details on CPU and GPU runtimes.

If the configuration you need is not available, you can
[build the library from source](https://oneapi-src.github.io/oneDNN/dev_guide_build.html).

# System Requirements

oneDNN supports platforms based on the following architectures:
- [Intel 64 or AMD64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64),
- [Arm 64-bit Architecture (AArch64)](https://developer.arm.com/architectures/cpu-architecture/a-profile).
- [OpenPOWER](https://openpowerfoundation.org/) / [IBM Power ISA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_ISA).
- [IBMz z/Architecture (s390x)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z/Architecture).

> **WARNING**
>
> Arm 64-bit Architecture (AArch64), Power ISA (PPC64) and IBMz (s390x) support
> is **experimental** with limited testing validation.

The library is optimized for the following CPUs:
* Intel Atom processor with Intel SSE4.1 support
* 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th generation Intel(R) Core(TM) processor
* Intel(R) Xeon(R) processor E3, E5, and E7 family (formerly Sandy Bridge,
  Ivy Bridge, Haswell, and Broadwell)
* Intel(R) Xeon Phi(TM) processor (formerly Knights Landing and Knights Mill)
* Intel Xeon Scalable processor (formerly Skylake, Cascade Lake, and Cooper
  Lake)
* future Intel Xeon Scalable processor (code name Sapphire Rapids)

On a CPU based on Intel 64 or on AMD64 architecture, oneDNN detects
the instruction set architecture (ISA) at runtime and uses just-in-time (JIT)
code generation to deploy the code optimized for the latest supported ISA.
Future ISAs may have initial support in the library disabled by default and
require the use of run-time controls to enable them. See
[CPU dispatcher control](https://oneapi-src.github.io/oneDNN/dev_guide_cpu_dispatcher_control.html)
for more details.

On a CPU based on Arm AArch64 architecture, oneDNN can be built with Arm
Compute Library integration. Arm Compute Library is an open-source
library for computer vision and machine learning applications and
provides AArch64 optimized implementations of core functions.
This functionality currently requires that Arm Compute Library is
downloaded and built separately, see
[Build from Source](https://oneapi-src.github.io/oneDNN/dev_guide_build.html).

> **WARNING**
>
> On macOS, applications that use oneDNN may need to request special
> entitlements if they use the hardened runtime. See the
> [linking guide](https://oneapi-src.github.io/oneDNN/dev_guide_link.html)
> for more details.

The library is optimized for the following GPUs:
* Intel HD Graphics
* Intel UHD Graphics
* Intel Iris Plus Graphics
* Xe architecture-based Graphics (code named DG1 and Tiger Lake)

## Requirements for Building from Source

oneDNN supports systems meeting the following requirements:
* Operating system with Intel 64 / Arm 64 / Power / IBMz architecture support
* C++ compiler with C++11 standard support
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) 2.8.11 or later
* [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/download.html#srcbin) 1.8.5 or later
  to build the documentation
* [Arm Compute Library](https://github.com/arm-software/ComputeLibrary)
  for builds using Compute Library on AArch64.

Configurations of CPU and GPU engines may introduce additional build time
dependencies.

### CPU Engine

oneDNN CPU engine is used to execute primitives on Intel Architecture
Processors, 64-bit Arm Architecture (AArch64) processors,
64-bit Power ISA (PPC64) processors, IBMz (s390x), and compatible devices.

The CPU engine is built by default and cannot be disabled at build time. The
engine can be configured to use the OpenMP or TBB threading runtime. The
following additional requirements apply:
* OpenMP runtime requires C++ compiler with OpenMP 2.0 or later
  standard support
* TBB runtime requires
[Threading Building Blocks (TBB)](https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/)
2017 or later.

Some implementations rely on OpenMP 4.0 SIMD extensions. For the best
performance results on Intel Architecture Processors we recommend using the
Intel C++ Compiler.

### GPU Engine

Intel Processor Graphics and Xe architecture-based Graphics are supported by
the oneDNN GPU engine. The GPU engine is disabled in the default build
configuration. The following additional requirements apply when GPU engine
is enabled:
* OpenCL\* runtime library (OpenCL version 1.2 or later)
* OpenCL driver (with kernel language support for OpenCL C 2.0 or later)
  with Intel subgroups extension support
