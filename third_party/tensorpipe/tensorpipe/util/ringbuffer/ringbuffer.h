/// C++17 implementation of shared-memory friendly perf_event style ringbuffer.
/// It's designed to avoid parallel access and provide (almost) zero-copy
///
///
/// A ringbuffer has a header and a data members that can be allocated
/// independently from the ringbuffer object, allowing the ringbuffer object
/// to be stored in process' exclusive memory while header and data
/// could be in shared memory.
///
/// Multiple ringbuffers can reference the same header + data.
///
/// Multiple producers (or consumers) can reference the same ringbuffer.
///
/// Synchronization between all producers/consumers of all ringbuffers that
/// reference the same header + pair pairs is done using atomic operations
/// care is taken to guarantee lock-free implementations, reduce the usage
/// of LOCK prefixes and the access to non-exclusive cache lines by CPUs.
///
/// Producers write data atomically at ringbuffer's head, while Consumers
/// write data atomically at ringbuffer's tail.
///

  // transaction could lead to races. This also means we need memory barriers
  // around a transaction, to make sure side-effects of other users are visible
  // upon entering and our side effects become visible to others upon exiting.
  // We also must prevent the compiler from reordering memory accesses. Failure
  // to do so may result in our reads of head/tail to look like they occurred
  // before we entered the transaction, and writes to them to look like they
  // occurred after we exited it. In order to get the desired behavior, we use
  // the acquire memory order when starting a transaction (which means no later
  // memory access can be moved before it) and the release memory order when
  // ending it (no earlier memory access can be moved after it).

  // consumer increases the tail, they give users of the opposite type the right
  // to access some of the memory that was previously under their control. Thus,
